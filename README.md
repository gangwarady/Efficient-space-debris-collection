# Efficient-space-debris-collection

For more than a decade, the Space Debris problem has become a major problem for space researchers. As of data of 2019, there are about
900,000 pieces of debris of size between 1 and
10 cm and there are more than 128 million debris
of size less than 1 cm traveling at the rate of 20
times the speed of the bullet.
With the growing space sector of countries,
the space environment is becoming crowded.
The major problem is when these space items
are used up then also they remain in the orbit
which is called space debris. These space debris can be collided with the satellites incurring
heavy losses to upcoming space programs. The
issue here is to deal with a plan that can take
these sub satellites efficiently to all the identified
debris in the range with the minimization of energy (fuel) and the time. This problem can be
modeled as a traveling salesman problem.
The method used for debris removal is Active
Debris Removal (ADR) which involves a parent
satellite with some small satellites in it. Whenever the parent satellite detects debris then it
releases the sub satellites from it which can
trap the debris using different de-orbit devices
equipped in them and move the debris to lower
orbit.
